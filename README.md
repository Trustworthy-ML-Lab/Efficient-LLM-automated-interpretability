# The Importance of Prompt Tuning for Automated Neuron Explanations

This is the official repository containing the code for our paper [The Importance of Prompt Tuning for Automated Neuron Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06200). We build heavily on OpenAIs [automated-interpretability](https://github.com/openai/automated-interpretability) and analyze the importance of specific prompt types used to generate new explanations, and find that simpler, more intuitive prompts such as our summary can increase both computational efficiency and quality of the generated explanations. In particular our simple "Summary" prompt shown below can outperform the original while requiring 2.4 times less input tokens per neuron.

Code will be released soon.
